#summary Collection of developing information and tools
= Introduction =

This page collects several information for developing this package. Currently it does not contain any user related data.

= Generating of files =
The following steps are required in that order to generate all files based on the files *cookingsymbols.ins* and *cookingsymbols.dtx*

== !DocStrip Utility ==
The command
{{{
latex cookingsymbols.ins
}}}
generates the METAFONT file `cookingsymbols.mf` and the style package file `cookingsymbols.sty`.


== Documentation ==
  * The command
  {{{
pdflatex cookingsymbols.dtx
  }}}
  creates the glossary and index files `cookingsymbols.idx` and `cookingsymbols.glo` and a (temporary) PDF documentation. It does not contain a glossary and an index if it is the first run.
  
  * The command
  {{{
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o cookingsymbols.gls cookingsymbols.glo
  }}}
  builds the glossary style file `cookingsymbols.gls`.
  * The command
  {{{
makeindex -s gind.ist -o cookingsymbols.ind cookingsymbols.idx
  }}}
  provides the index style file `cookingsymbols.ind`.
  * The command
  {{{
pdflatex cookingsymbols.dtx
  }}}
  compiles the complete documentation.

== METAFONT ==
  * The command
  {{{
mf.exe cookingsymbols.mf
  }}}
  generates the file `cookingsymbols.2602gf`.
  * The command
  {{{
gftodvi cookingsymbols.2602gf
  }}}
  converts the previously generated file and saves it to the file `cookingsymbols.dvi`.


= Paths for generated files =
If you are using Windows 7 and MikTeX the new files have to be stored at and therefore updated at the following paths.

== .pk ==
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\MikTeX\2.9\fonts\pk\ljfour\public\cookingsymbols`

== .mf (and .gen) ==
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\MikTeX\2.9\fonts\source\public\cookingsymbols`

== .sty and .fd ==
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\MikTeX\2.9\tex\latex\cookingsymbols`

== .tfm ==
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\MikTeX\2.9\fonts\tfm\public\cookingsymbols`
